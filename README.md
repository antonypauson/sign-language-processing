# ✌️ ASL ⭤ English Translation with MediaPipe, PointNet, ThreeJS and Semantic Search

American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that exhibits the same linguistic complexities as spoken languages, including its own syntax, morphology, and grammar that significantly differ from English. Most existing tools that aim to bridge ASL and English often prioritize the needs of hearing individuals, simply offering Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text capabilities (STT), developed under the misconception that ASL is an identical language to English.

> [!NOTE]
> As a hearing student with limited ASL proficiency, I recognize that my perspective as a hearing person is extremely limited. My role has been to listen carefully and integrate feedback from the Deaf community, and I have done my best to approach this project with a mindset of learning and understanding, rather than assuming. This project would not have been possible without the active involvement and advice of Deaf individuals and ASL experts who have generously shared their insights.

This project is a prototype that enables translation between American Sign Language (ASL) and English, facilitating communication between ASL signers and individuals who do not understand ASL. It is still far from accurately translating the nuances of visual language, but it is designed to respect and preserve ASL as the primary language. The interface provides two main functionalities:

<table style="width: 100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 50%">ASL Fingerspelling → English Translation</th>
    <th style="width: 50%">English → ASL Sign Translation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Translates ASL fingerspelling into written English, which is then spoken aloud. Removes the need for Deaf individuals to translate their thoughts into English, and then write them out.</td>
    <td>Translates spoken English into ASL signs, which are then signed by a moving avatar. Removes the need for Deaf individuals to read written English and translate it into visual ASL signs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Motivation

When I moved to Vancouver in 2021, I was given the unique opportunity to study a new kind of language — a visual language — in my high school.
