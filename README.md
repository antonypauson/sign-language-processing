## Motivation

Throughout elementary and middle school, I attempted to learn 4 different languages (Hindi, Spanish, Sanskrit and French), but despite investing years into each, I was never able to develop working proficiency in any of them. However, when I moved to Greater Vancouver in 2021, I was provided with the unique opportunity to study a new kind of language — a visual language — in my high school. Over the last three years, learning ASL and studying in the same building as BC's Secondary School for the Deaf has been an insightful experience, introducing me to a new perspective on language and lifestyle.

Initially, back in Grade 9, I was introduced to the basics of ASL, learning the alphabet, numbers, and basic phrases. At this time, I was interested in developing some kind of ASL-related technology, primarily focusing on creating visual and vibratory experiences for music; however, I never got myself to build anything viable.
