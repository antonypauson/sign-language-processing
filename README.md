## Motivation

When I moved to Vancouver in 2021, I was provided with the unique opportunity to study a new kind of language — a visual language — in my high school. Over the last three years, learning ASL and studying in the same building as British Columbia's Secondary School for the Deaf has been an insightful experience, introducing me to a new perspective on language and lifestyle.

Initially, back in Grade 9, I was introduced to the basics of ASL, learning the alphabet, numbers, and basic phrases. At this time, I was interested in developing some kind of ASL-related technology, primarily focusing on creating visual and vibratory experiences for music; however, I never got myself to build anything viable.
